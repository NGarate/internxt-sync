/**
 * Integration Tests for Internxt WebDAV Uploader
 * 
 * NOTE: This file serves as documentation of what integration tests would test,
 * but it doesn't implement them because they would require a complex mocking setup
 * that is difficult to implement in the Bun test environment.
 * 
 * The following functionality is tested in separate unit tests:
 * - `uploader.test.js` tests the core file upload functionality with curl
 * - `file-scanner.test.js` tests the directory scanning and checksum calculation
 * - `internxt-cli.test.js` tests the CLI interface and commands
 * - `webdav-service.test.js` tests the WebDAV connectivity and operations
 * 
 * The main integration points that would be tested here include:
 * 1. Complete workflow with default settings
 * 2. Help text display and exiting
 * 3. Error handling when sourceDir is not provided
 * 4. Error handling when setup fails
 * 5. Skipping setup when skipSetup flag is true and webdavUrl is provided
 * 6. WebDAV status checking when skipSetup is true but webdavUrl is not provided
 * 7. Exiting with error when webdavUrl is not available
 * 8. Success message when no files need to be uploaded
 * 9. Error handling during upload process
 * 
 * These tests are better suited for end-to-end testing with a real environment
 * or more advanced mocking frameworks beyond the scope of this project.
